## Introduction
The pan-genome concept encompasses protein-coding gene sequences subject to presence-absence variations (PAVs) among multiple accessions of a species, some of which may be absent in the reference sequence. In some cases, the plant pan-transcriptome may serve as an approximation of the pan-genome. It is defined as genes expressed across a set of accessions of a species. This approach considers expression-based presence-absence variations (ePAVs). Nevertheless, structural features of pan-genomes and pan-transcriptomes show close correspondence
